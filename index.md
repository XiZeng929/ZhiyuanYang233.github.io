This blog is created for ST558, which is my data science course.

My name is Zhiyuan Yang. I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in **statistics** with a traditional concentration at North Carolina State University. Through statistical practice courses, I have accumulated plenty of experience in analyzing real data, cleaning data, transforming data structure, and constructing appropriate regression models.  I am now skilled in SAS, R, Python, SQL, Java. I prepare to graduate at **Dec 2022**. This semester, I am taking the data science course, which makes me feel excited. Hope i can learn a lot in this course.
